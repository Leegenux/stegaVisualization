INTRODUCTION 

TO 

JANE EYRE 



'JANE EYRE' was first published in October 1847. Half 
a century since this tale of the North by an unknown writer 
stole upon London, and, in the very midst of the serial publi- 
cation of ' Vanity Fair,' took the town by storm, obtaining for 
its author in the course of a few weeks a success which, as 
the creator of Becky Sharp afterwards said to her, a little 
sadly and sharply, 'it took me the work of ten years to 
achieve.' 

Half a century, in the view of the Roman Church, is often 
hardly sufficient to decide even the first step in the process 
of canonisation ; it is generally amply sufficient to decide all 
matters of literary rank and permanence. How has the ver- 
dict gone in the case of Currer Bell ? Have these fifty years 
'cut all meaning from the name,' or have they but filled it 
with a fuller content, wreathed it with memories and associa- 
tions that will for ever keep it luminous and delightful amid 
the dim tracts of the past ? 

Judging by the books that have been written and read in 
recent years, by the common verdict as to the Bronte sisters, 
their story, and their work, which prevails, almost without ex- 
ception, in the literary criticism of the present day; by the 
tone of personal tenderness, even of passionate homage, in 
which many writers speak of Charlotte and of Emily ; and by 
the increasing recognition which their books have obtained 



x JANE EYRE 

abroad, one may say with some confidence that the name and 
memory of the Brontes were never more alive than now, that 
' Honour and Fame have got about their graves ' for good 
and all, and that Charlotte and Emily Bronte are no less 
secure, at any rate, than Jane Austen or George Eliot or 
Mrs. Browning of literary recollection in the time to come. 

But if the Brontes live, their books live also. There are 
some names of the past Byron Voltaire that are far 
greater now, more full of magic and of spell, than the 
books associated with them that are, in fact, separable 
from the books, and could almost live on without them. But 
Charlotte Bronte is Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe. You can- 
not think of her apart from what she has written, and every- 
thing that she wrote has the challenging quality of personal 
emotion or of passion, moving in a narrow range among very 
concrete things, and intimately fused throughout with the in- 
cidents and feelings of one small, intense experience : so that, 
if one finds, as one does find abundantly, that the Brontes are 
remembered, it must be that their books are read, that people 
still sit up into the night with 'Jane Eyre,' and are still as 
angry as they were at the first, that they can get no one to 
assure them of Paul Emmanuel's safe return. 

So it must be; and so, indeed, the personal experience of 
most of us can vouch that it is. Nevertheless, here and 
there one may hear a protesting voice. Here and there a 
reader and generally a reader of more subtlety and range 
than his fellows struck with the union of certain extrava- 
gances and certain dogmatisms in Charlotte Bronte's work, 
with the weakness of Anne's and the crudity of Emily's, will 
dare to say, ' Not at all ! The vitality of the Bronte fame 
does not mean primarily the vitality of the Bronte books. It 
is a vitality which springs from the English love of the pa- 
thetic and the picturesque, and the English tendency to sub- 
ordinate matters of art to matters of sentiment. Mrs. Gas- 
kell, herself an accomplished novelist, wrote an account of 
these lonely girls on a Yorkshire moor, struggling with pov- 
erty and consumption, developing genius in the very wrestle 
with death, taking the heaven of fame by violence, and per- 



INTRODUCTION xi 

ishing in the effort. She showed them to us oppressed by 
poverty and by daily contact with a vicious brother, and yet, 
through it all, remaining dutiful, loving, and virtuous, as the 
good English public likes them to be: she describes the 
deaths the piteous deaths of two of the sisters in the very 
moment, or on the very threshold, of success, and, finally, her 
narrative brought us to the death of Charlotte herself 
Charlotte snatched from happiness and from motherhood, 
after one brief year of married life : and so skilful is the tell- 
ing, so touching the story, that the great English heart goes 
out to it, and forthwith the Bronte books must be books of 
genius, because the Brontes are so interesting and their story 
so tragic.' 

Perhaps this explanation is put forward to account rather 
for the continuance of the Brontes' fame than for their origi- 
nal success. Such a critic would admit that 'Jane Eyre' 
is at least a vivid and exciting story; that 'Villette' has at 
least passages of extraordinary brilliance: but he will obsti- 
nately maintain, none the less, that other books, now forgot- 
ten, have had as much, and that the Bronte ' legend ' has 
unfairly strengthened the claim of the Bronte stories upon 
posterity. 

Let us see how such a contention stands in the case of 
' Jane Eyre.' ' Jane Eyre ' to run through a summary of 
the plot is the story of an orphan girl, reared at a Charity 
School amid many hardships, going out into the world as a 
governess, and falling in love with her employer, Mr. Roch- 
ester. She yields herself to her own passion and to his 
masterful love-making with an eager, an over-eager abandon- 
ment. The wedding-day is fixed ; the small marriage party 
assembles. But in the very church, and at the moment of 
the ceremony, it is revealed to Jane Eyre that Mr. Rochester 
has a wife living, a frenzied lunatic who has been confined 
for months in a corner of the same house where she and 
Rochester have had their daily dwelling; that Rochester 
has deliberately entrapped her, and that she stands on the 
edge of an abyss. The marriage party breaks up in confu- 
sion; and Rochester's next endeavour is to persuade the 



xii JANE EYRE 

stunned and miserable Jane to scout law and convention, and 
fly with him to love and foreign parts. He shows her the 
lunatic, in all the odious horror of her state, and Jane for- 
gives him on the spot, having never indeed, so far as ap- 
pears, felt any deep resentment of his conduct. Neverthe- 
less, she summons up courage to leave him. She steals away 
by night, and, after days of wandering and starvation, she 
finds a home with the Rivers family, who ultimately turn out 
to be her cousins. St. John Rivers, the brother of the fam- 
ily, an Evangelical clergyman possessed with a fanatical en- 
thusiasm for missionary life, observes the girl's strong and 
energetic nature, and makes up his mind to marry her, not 
in the least because he loves her, but because he thinks her 
fitted to be a missionary's wife. Her will is on the point of 
yielding to his, when she hears a mysterious midnight call 
from Rochester ; she hurries back to her master, to find him 
blinded and maimed by the fire which has destroyed his house 
and his mad wife together; and of course the end is happiness. 
Now certainly there never was a plot, which pretended to 
be a plot, of looser texture than that of ' Jane Eyre.' It 
abounds with absurdities and inconsistencies. The critics of 
Charlotte Bronte's time had no difficulty in pointing them 
out ; they He, indeed, on the surface for all to see. That 
such incidents should have happened to Jane Eyre in Mr. 
Rochester's house as did happen, without awakening her sus- 
picions ; that the existence of a lunatic should have been 
commonly known to all the servants of the house, yet wholly 
concealed from the governess; that Mr. Rochester should 
have been a man of honour and generosity, a man with whom 
not only Jane Eyre, but clearly the writer herself, is in love, 
and yet capable of deliberately betraying and deceiving a girl 
of twenty placed in a singularly helpless position ; these are 
the fundamental puzzles of the story. Mrs. Fairfax is a 
mystery throughout. How, knowing what she did, did she 
not inevitably know more? what was her real relation to 
Rochester ? to Jane Eyre ? These are questions that no 
one can answer out of the four corners of the book. The 
country-house party is a tissue of extravagance throughout; 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

the sarcasms and brutalities of the beautiful Miss Ingram 
are no more credible than the manners assumed by the aris- 
tocratic Rochester from the beginning towards his ward's 
governess, or the amazing freedom with which he pours into 
the ears of the same governess a virtuous girl of twenty, 
who has been no more than a few weeks under his roof the 
story of his relations with Adele's mother. 

Turn to the early scenes, for instance, between Jane and 
Rochester. They have been ' several days ' under the same 
roof ; it is Jane's second interview with her employer. Mr. 
Rochester, in Sultan fashion, sends for her and her pupil 
after dinner. He sits silent, while Jane's quick eye takes 
note of him. Suddenly he turns upon her. 

' You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he ; 'do you think me 
handsome?' 

Jane, taken by surprise, delivers a stout negative, whereupon 
her employer, in caprice or pique, pursues the subject further: 

' Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?' 

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally 
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual 
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benev- 
olence should have risen. 
' Now, ma'am, am I a fool ?' 

Poor Jane gets out of the dilemma as best she can, and 
gradually this astonishing gentleman thaws, becomes conver- 
sational and kind. And this is how he puts the little gov- 
erness at her ease : 

' You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre ; and though you 
are not pretty, any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air 
becomes you ; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those search- 
ing eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them 
with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on. Young lady, 
I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.' 

' Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communica- 
te to - night /' Not even ' Mr. Rawchester ' could exceed 
this. Parody has nothing to add. 



xiv JANE EYRE 

The country - house party is equally far from anything 
known, either to realistic or romantic truth, even to the truth 
as it existed in the days of 'Jane Eyre's' Quarterly Re- 
viewer and the Cowan Bridge School. Listen to the badinage 
of the beautiful and accomplished Miss Ingram. She is mak- 
ing brutal fun of governesses, in order to be overheard by 
the shy and shrinking Jane behind the window-curtain. Miss 
Ingram, it should be remarked, has never seen Jane before, 
has no grievance against her, and can only be supposed to 
be displaying the aristocratic temper as such. It pleases her 
to describe a love affair that her childhood had discovered 
between her own governess and her brother's tutor. She 
tells how she and her precious brothers and sisters employed 
it the love affair 'as a sort of lever to hoist our dead- 
weights from the house.' 

'. . . Dear mamma, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the 
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did 
you not, my lady-mother?' 

' Certainly, my best. And I was quite right, depend on that ; 
there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses 
and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well- 
regulated house ; firstly ' 

' Oh, gracious, mamrna ! spare us the enumeration ! An reste, 
we all know them : danger of bad example to the innocence of 
childhood distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the 
part of the attached mutual alliance and reliance; confidence 
thence resulting insolence accompanying mutiny and general 
blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ?' 

Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ! 

But Miss Ingram can also show herself as the gay and 
sprightly trifler with Rochester's well-bred homage. 

' Whenever I marry,' she continued, after a pause which none 
interrupted, ' I am resolved that my husband shall not be a rival, 
but a foil. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.' 

' I am all obedience,' was the response. 

' Here, then, is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs ; 
and for that reason sing it " con spirito." ' 

Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a 
mug of milk and water.' 



INTRODUCTION xv 

And so on. The whole scene from beginning to end is a 
piece of heavy grotesque, without either the truth or the fun 
of good satire. It was these pages, of course, and certain 
others like them in the book, that set George Henry Lewes 
preaching the 'mild eyes,' the 'truth,' and 'finish' of Miss 
Austen to the new and stormy genius which had produced 
' Jane Eyre.' And one may see, perhaps, in Charlotte's sore- 
ness, in the very vehemence that she shows under this particu- 
lar criticism, that, secretly, the shaft has gone home. She is, 
after all, infinitely shrewd, sensitive, and, in the end, just. She 
wrote a petulant letter to Mr. Lewes ; but she sent for ' Pride 
and Prejudice,' which she had never read, and the proba- 
bility is that, in spite of a natural antipathy, her quick eye 
took note at once of the fineness of stroke that goes to cari- 
cature itself in that immortal book ; that she pondered Mr. 
Collins and Lady Catharine de Burgh ; and that in the com- 
parative ease and urbanity which marked the painting of 
manners in ' Shirley,' the influence of her tilt with Lewes 
counts for something, 

As to the other weaknesses of plot and conception, they 
are very obvious and very simple. The 'arrangements' by 
which Jane Eyre is led to find a home in the Rivers house- 
hold, and becomes at once her uncle's heiress, and the good 
angel of her newly discovered cousins; the device of the 
phantom voice that recalls her to Rochester's side ; the fire 
that destroys the mad wife, and delivers into Jane's hands a 
subdued and helpless Rochester ; all these belong to that 
more mechanical and external sort of plot-making, which the 
modern novelist of feeling and passion as distinguished 
from the novelist of adventure prides himself on renouncing. 
To him the painting of a situation like that, say, in Benjamin 
Constant's ' Adolphe ' infinitely true, and wholly insoluble 
where the writer scorns to apply any coercive framework, 
any rough-and-ready 'plot' to his material, is the admirable 
and important thing. The true subject of ' Jane Eyre ' is the 
courage with which a friendless and loving girl confronts her 
own passion, and, in the interest of some strange social in- 
stinct which she knows as ' duty,' which she cannot explain 



xvi JANE EYRE 

and can only obey, tramples her love underfoot, and goes 
out miserable into the world. Beside this wrestle of the 
human will, everything else is trivial or vulgar. The various 
expedients legacies, uncles, fires, and coincidences by 
which Jane Eyre is ultimately brought to happiness, cheapen 
and degrade the book without convincing the reader. In 
fact to return to our advocatus diaboli ' " Jane Eyre " is on 
the one side a rather poor novel of incident, planned on the 
conventional pattern, and full of clumsy execution ; on an- 
other side it is a picture of passion and of ideas, for which in 
truth the writer had no sufficient equipment ; she moves im- 
prisoned, to quote Mr. Leslie Stephen, in " a narrow circle 
of thoughts ;" if you press it, the psychology of the book is 
really childish ; Rochester is absurd, Jane Eyre, in spite of 
the stir that she makes, only half-realised and half-conscious. 
Still, as a study of feeling, adapted to some extent to modern 
realist demands, the novel came at a happy moment. It is 
one of the signs, no doubt, that mark the transition from the 
old novel to the new, from the old novel of plot and coinci- 
dence to the new novel of psychology and character. But, 
given the defects of the book, how is it possible to assign it 
a high place in the history of that great modern art which 
has commanded the knowledge of a Tolstoy, and the mind 
of a Turgue'nieff, which is the subtle interpreter and not the 
vulgar stage-manager of nature, which shrinks from the mere-

INTRODUCTION 

TO 

JANE EYRE 



'JANE EYRE' was first published in October 1847. Half 
a century since this tale of the North by an unknown writer 
stole upon London, and, in the very midst of the serial publi- 
cation of ' Vanity Fair,' took the town by storm, obtaining for 
its author in the course of a few weeks a success which, as 
the creator of Becky Sharp afterwards said to her, a little 
sadly and sharply, 'it took me the work of ten years to 
achieve.' 

Half a century, in the view of the Roman Church, is often 
hardly sufficient to decide even the first step in the process 
of canonisation ; it is generally amply sufficient to decide all 
matters of literary rank and permanence. How has the ver- 
dict gone in the case of Currer Bell ? Have these fifty years 
'cut all meaning from the name,' or have they but filled it 
with a fuller content, wreathed it with memories and associa- 
tions that will for ever keep it luminous and delightful amid 
the dim tracts of the past ? 

Judging by the books that have been written and read in 
recent years, by the common verdict as to the Bronte sisters, 
their story, and their work, which prevails, almost without ex- 
ception, in the literary criticism of the present day; by the 
tone of personal tenderness, even of passionate homage, in 
which many writers speak of Charlotte and of Emily ; and by 
the increasing recognition which their books have obtained 



x JANE EYRE 

abroad, one may say with some confidence that the name and 
memory of the Brontes were never more alive than now, that 
' Honour and Fame have got about their graves ' for good 
and all, and that Charlotte and Emily Bronte are no less 
secure, at any rate, than Jane Austen or George Eliot or 
Mrs. Browning of literary recollection in the time to come. 

But if the Brontes live, their books live also. There are 
some names of the past Byron Voltaire that are far 
greater now, more full of magic and of spell, than the 
books associated with them that are, in fact, separable 
from the books, and could almost live on without them. But 
Charlotte Bronte is Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe. You can- 
not think of her apart from what she has written, and every- 
thing that she wrote has the challenging quality of personal 
emotion or of passion, moving in a narrow range among very 
concrete things, and intimately fused throughout with the in- 
cidents and feelings of one small, intense experience : so that, 
if one finds, as one does find abundantly, that the Brontes are 
remembered, it must be that their books are read, that people 
still sit up into the night with 'Jane Eyre,' and are still as 
angry as they were at the first, that they can get no one to 
assure them of Paul Emmanuel's safe return. 

So it must be; and so, indeed, the personal experience of 
most of us can vouch that it is. Nevertheless, here and 
there one may hear a protesting voice. Here and there a 
reader and generally a reader of more subtlety and range 
than his fellows struck with the union of certain extrava- 
gances and certain dogmatisms in Charlotte Bronte's work, 
with the weakness of Anne's and the crudity of Emily's, will 
dare to say, ' Not at all ! The vitality of the Bronte fame 
does not mean primarily the vitality of the Bronte books. It 
is a vitality which springs from the English love of the pa- 
thetic and the picturesque, and the English tendency to sub- 
ordinate matters of art to matters of sentiment. Mrs. Gas- 
kell, herself an accomplished novelist, wrote an account of 
these lonely girls on a Yorkshire moor, struggling with pov- 
erty and consumption, developing genius in the very wrestle 
with death, taking the heaven of fame by violence, and per- 



INTRODUCTION xi 

ishing in the effort. She showed them to us oppressed by 
poverty and by daily contact with a vicious brother, and yet, 
through it all, remaining dutiful, loving, and virtuous, as the 
good English public likes them to be: she describes the 
deaths the piteous deaths of two of the sisters in the very 
moment, or on the very threshold, of success, and, finally, her 
narrative brought us to the death of Charlotte herself 
Charlotte snatched from happiness and from motherhood, 
after one brief year of married life : and so skilful is the tell- 
ing, so touching the story, that the great English heart goes 
out to it, and forthwith the Bronte books must be books of 
genius, because the Brontes are so interesting and their story 
so tragic.' 

Perhaps this explanation is put forward to account rather 
for the continuance of the Brontes' fame than for their origi- 
nal success. Such a critic would admit that 'Jane Eyre' 
is at least a vivid and exciting story; that 'Villette' has at 
least passages of extraordinary brilliance: but he will obsti- 
nately maintain, none the less, that other books, now forgot- 
ten, have had as much, and that the Bronte ' legend ' has 
unfairly strengthened the claim of the Bronte stories upon 
posterity. 

Let us see how such a contention stands in the case of 
' Jane Eyre.' ' Jane Eyre ' to run through a summary of 
the plot is the story of an orphan girl, reared at a Charity 
School amid many hardships, going out into the world as a 
governess, and falling in love with her employer, Mr. Roch- 
ester. She yields herself to her own passion and to his 
masterful love-making with an eager, an over-eager abandon- 
ment. The wedding-day is fixed ; the small marriage party 
assembles. But in the very church, and at the moment of 
the ceremony, it is revealed to Jane Eyre that Mr. Rochester 
has a wife living, a frenzied lunatic who has been confined 
for months in a corner of the same house where she and 
Rochester have had their daily dwelling; that Rochester 
has deliberately entrapped her, and that she stands on the 
edge of an abyss. The marriage party breaks up in confu- 
sion; and Rochester's next endeavour is to persuade the 



xii JANE EYRE 

stunned and miserable Jane to scout law and convention, and 
fly with him to love and foreign parts. He shows her the 
lunatic, in all the odious horror of her state, and Jane for- 
gives him on the spot, having never indeed, so far as ap- 
pears, felt any deep resentment of his conduct. Neverthe- 
less, she summons up courage to leave him. She steals away 
by night, and, after days of wandering and starvation, she 
finds a home with the Rivers family, who ultimately turn out 
to be her cousins. St. John Rivers, the brother of the fam- 
ily, an Evangelical clergyman possessed with a fanatical en- 
thusiasm for missionary life, observes the girl's strong and 
energetic nature, and makes up his mind to marry her, not 
in the least because he loves her, but because he thinks her 
fitted to be a missionary's wife. Her will is on the point of 
yielding to his, when she hears a mysterious midnight call 
from Rochester ; she hurries back to her master, to find him 
blinded and maimed by the fire which has destroyed his house 
and his mad wife together; and of course the end is happiness. 
Now certainly there never was a plot, which pretended to 
be a plot, of looser texture than that of ' Jane Eyre.' It 
abounds with absurdities and inconsistencies. The critics of 
Charlotte Bronte's time had no difficulty in pointing them 
out ; they He, indeed, on the surface for all to see. That 
such incidents should have happened to Jane Eyre in Mr. 
Rochester's house as did happen, without awakening her sus- 
picions ; that the existence of a lunatic should have been 
commonly known to all the servants of the house, yet wholly 
concealed from the governess; that Mr. Rochester should 
have been a man of honour and generosity, a man with whom 
not only Jane Eyre, but clearly the writer herself, is in love, 
and yet capable of deliberately betraying and deceiving a girl 
of twenty placed in a singularly helpless position ; these are 
the fundamental puzzles of the story. Mrs. Fairfax is a 
mystery throughout. How, knowing what she did, did she 
not inevitably know more? what was her real relation to 
Rochester ? to Jane Eyre ? These are questions that no 
one can answer out of the four corners of the book. The 
country-house party is a tissue of extravagance throughout; 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

the sarcasms and brutalities of the beautiful Miss Ingram 
are no more credible than the manners assumed by the aris- 
tocratic Rochester from the beginning towards his ward's 
governess, or the amazing freedom with which he pours into 
the ears of the same governess a virtuous girl of twenty, 
who has been no more than a few weeks under his roof the 
story of his relations with Adele's mother. 

Turn to the early scenes, for instance, between Jane and 
Rochester. They have been ' several days ' under the same 
roof ; it is Jane's second interview with her employer. Mr. 
Rochester, in Sultan fashion, sends for her and her pupil 
after dinner. He sits silent, while Jane's quick eye takes

' You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he ; 'do you think me

Jane, taken by surprise, delivers a stout negative, whereupon 
her employer, in caprice or pique, pursues the subject further: 

' Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?' 

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally 
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual 
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benev- 
olence should have risen. 
' Now, ma'am, am I a fool ?' 

Poor Jane gets out of the dilemma as best she can, and 
gradually this astonishing gentleman thaws, becomes conver- 
sational and kind. And this is how he puts the little gov- 
erness at her ease : 

' You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre ; and though you 
are not pretty, any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air 
becomes you ; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those search- 
ing eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them 
with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on. Young lady, 
I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.' 

' Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communica- 
te to - night /' Not even ' Mr. Rawchester ' could exceed 
this. Parody has nothing to add. 



xiv JANE EYRE 

The country - house party is equally far from anything 
known, either to realistic or romantic truth, even to the truth 
as it existed in the days of 'Jane Eyre's' Quarterly Re- 
viewer and the Cowan Bridge School. Listen to the badinage 
of the beautiful and accomplished Miss Ingram. She is mak- 
ing brutal fun of governesses, in order to be overheard by 
the shy and shrinking Jane behind the window-curtain. Miss 
Ingram, it should be remarked, has never seen Jane before, 
has no grievance against her, and can only be supposed to 
be displaying the aristocratic temper as such. It pleases her 
to describe a love affair that her childhood had discovered 
between her own governess and her brother's tutor. She 
tells how she and her precious brothers and sisters employed 
it the love affair 'as a sort of lever to hoist our dead- 
weights from the house.' 

'. . . Dear mamma, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the 
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did 
you not, my lady-mother?' 

' Certainly, my best. And I was quite right, depend on that ; 
there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses 
and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well- 
regulated house ; firstly ' 

' Oh, gracious, mamrna ! spare us the enumeration ! An reste, 
we all know them : danger of bad example to the innocence of 
childhood distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the 
part of the attached mutual alliance and reliance; confidence 
thence resulting insolence accompanying mutiny and general 
blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ?' 

Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ! 

But Miss Ingram can also show herself as the gay and 
sprightly trifler with Rochester's well-bred homage. 

' Whenever I marry,' she continued, after a pause which none 
interrupted, ' I am resolved that my husband shall not be a rival, 
but a foil. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.' 

' I am all obedience,' was the response. 

' Here, then, is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs ; 
and for that reason sing it " con spirito." ' 

Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a 
mug of milk and water.' 



INTRODUCTION xv 

And so on. The whole scene from beginning to end is a 
piece of heavy grotesque, without either the truth or the fun 
of good satire. It was these pages, of course, and certain 
others like them in the book, that set George Henry Lewes 
preaching the 'mild eyes,' the 'truth,' and 'finish' of Miss 
Austen to the new and stormy genius which had produced 
' Jane Eyre.' And one may see, perhaps, in Charlotte's sore- 
ness, in the very vehemence that she shows under this particu- 
lar criticism, that, secretly, the shaft has gone home. She is, 
after all, infinitely shrewd, sensitive, and, in the end, just. She 
wrote a petulant letter to Mr. Lewes ; but she sent for ' Pride 
and Prejudice,' which she had never read, and the proba- 
bility is that, in spite of a natural antipathy, her quick eye 
took note at once of the fineness of stroke that goes to cari- 
cature itself in that immortal book ; that she pondered Mr. 
Collins and Lady Catharine de Burgh ; and that in the com- 
parative ease and urbanity which marked the painting of 
manners in ' Shirley,' the influence of her tilt with Lewes 
counts for something, 

As to the other weaknesses of plot and conception, they 
are very obvious and very simple. The 'arrangements' by 
which Jane Eyre is led to find a home in the Rivers house- 
hold, and becomes at once her uncle's heiress, and the good 
angel of her newly discovered cousins; the device of the 
phantom voice that recalls her to Rochester's side ; the fire 
that destroys the mad wife, and delivers into Jane's hands a 
subdued and helpless Rochester ; all these belong to that 
more mechanical and external sort of plot-making, which the 
modern novelist of feeling and passion as distinguished 
from the novelist of adventure prides himself on renouncing. 
To him the painting of a situation like that, say, in Benjamin 
Constant's ' Adolphe ' infinitely true, and wholly insoluble 
where the writer scorns to apply any coercive framework, 
any rough-and-ready 'plot' to his material, is the admirable 
and important thing. The true subject of ' Jane Eyre ' is the 
courage with which a friendless and loving girl confronts her 
own passion, and, in the interest of some strange social in- 
stinct which she knows as ' duty,' which she cannot explain 



xvi JANE EYRE 

and can only obey, tramples her love underfoot, and goes 
out miserable into the world. Beside this wrestle of the 
human will, everything else is trivial or vulgar. The various 
expedients legacies, uncles, fires, and coincidences by 
which Jane Eyre is ultimately brought to happiness, cheapen 
and degrade the book without convincing the reader. In 
fact to return to our advocatus diaboli ' " Jane Eyre " is on 
the one side a rather poor novel of incident, planned on the 
conventional pattern, and full of clumsy execution ; on an- 
other side it is a picture of passion and of ideas, for which in 
truth the writer had no sufficient equipment ; she moves im- 
prisoned, to quote Mr. Leslie Stephen, in " a narrow circle 
of thoughts ;" if you press it, the psychology of the book is 
really childish ; Rochester is absurd, Jane Eyre, in spite of 
the stir that she makes, only half-realised and half-conscious. 
Still, as a study of feeling, adapted to some extent to modern 
realist demands, the novel came at a happy moment. It is 
one of the signs, no doubt, that mark the transition from the 
old novel to the new, from the old novel of plot and coinci- 
dence to the new novel of psychology and character. But, 
given the defects of the book, how is it possible to assign it 
a high place in the history of that great modern art which 
has commanded the knowledge of a Tolstoy, and the mind 
of a Turgue'nieff, which is the subtle interpreter and not the 
vulgar stage-manager of nature, which shrinks from the mere-

INTRODUCTION 

TO 

JANE EYRE 



'JANE EYRE' was first published in October 1847. Half 
a century since this tale of the North by an unknown writer 
stole upon London, and, in the very midst of the serial publi- 
cation of ' Vanity Fair,' took the town by storm, obtaining for 
its author in the course of a few weeks a success which, as 
the creator of Becky Sharp afterwards said to her, a little 
sadly and sharply, 'it took me the work of ten years to 
achieve.' 

Half a century, in the view of the Roman Church, is often 
hardly sufficient to decide even the first step in the process 
of canonisation ; it is generally amply sufficient to decide all 
matters of literary rank and permanence. How has the ver- 
dict gone in the case of Currer Bell ? Have these fifty years 
'cut all meaning from the name,' or have they but filled it 
with a fuller content, wreathed it with memories and associa- 
tions that will for ever keep it luminous and delightful amid 
the dim tracts of the past ? 

Judging by the books that have been written and read in 
recent years, by the common verdict as to the Bronte sisters, 
their story, and their work, which prevails, almost without ex- 
ception, in the literary criticism of the present day; by the 
tone of personal tenderness, even of passionate homage, in 
which many writers speak of Charlotte and of Emily ; and by 
the increasing recognition which their books have obtained 



x JANE EYRE 

abroad, one may say with some confidence that the name and 
memory of the Brontes were never more alive than now, that 
' Honour and Fame have got about their graves ' for good 
and all, and that Charlotte and Emily Bronte are no less 
secure, at any rate, than Jane Austen or George Eliot or 
Mrs. Browning of literary recollection in the time to come. 

But if the Brontes live, their books live also. There are 
some names of the past Byron Voltaire that are far 
greater now, more full of magic and of spell, than the 
books associated with them that are, in fact, separable 
from the books, and could almost live on without them. But 
Charlotte Bronte is Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe. You can- 
not think of her apart from what she has written, and every- 
thing that she wrote has the challenging quality of personal 
emotion or of passion, moving in a narrow range among very 
concrete things, and intimately fused throughout with the in- 
cidents and feelings of one small, intense experience : so that, 
if one finds, as one does find abundantly, that the Brontes are 
remembered, it must be that their books are read, that people 
still sit up into the night with 'Jane Eyre,' and are still as 
angry as they were at the first, that they can get no one to 
assure them of Paul Emmanuel's safe return. 

So it must be; and so, indeed, the personal experience of 
most of us can vouch that it is. Nevertheless, here and 
there one may hear a protesting voice. Here and there a 
reader and generally a reader of more subtlety and range 
than his fellows struck with the union of certain extrava- 
gances and certain dogmatisms in Charlotte Bronte's work, 
with the weakness of Anne's and the crudity of Emily's, will 
dare to say, ' Not at all ! The vitality of the Bronte fame 
does not mean primarily the vitality of the Bronte books. It 
is a vitality which springs from the English love of the pa- 
thetic and the picturesque, and the English tendency to sub- 
ordinate matters of art to matters of sentiment. Mrs. Gas- 
kell, herself an accomplished novelist, wrote an account of 
these lonely girls on a Yorkshire moor, struggling with pov- 
erty and consumption, developing genius in the very wrestle 
with death, taking the heaven of fame by violence, and per- 



INTRODUCTION xi 

ishing in the effort. She showed them to us oppressed by 
poverty and by daily contact with a vicious brother, and yet, 
through it all, remaining dutiful, loving, and virtuous, as the 
good English public likes them to be: she describes the 
deaths the piteous deaths of two of the sisters in the very 
moment, or on the very threshold, of success, and, finally, her 
narrative brought us to the death of Charlotte herself 
Charlotte snatched from happiness and from motherhood, 
after one brief year of married life : and so skilful is the tell- 
ing, so touching the story, that the great English heart goes 
out to it, and forthwith the Bronte books must be books of 
genius, because the Brontes are so interesting and their story 
so tragic.' 

Perhaps this explanation is put forward to account rather 
for the continuance of the Brontes' fame than for their origi- 
nal success. Such a critic would admit that 'Jane Eyre' 
is at least a vivid and exciting story; that 'Villette' has at 
least passages of extraordinary brilliance: but he will obsti- 
nately maintain, none the less, that other books, now forgot- 
ten, have had as much, and that the Bronte ' legend ' has 
unfairly strengthened the claim of the Bronte stories upon 
posterity. 

Let us see how such a contention stands in the case of 
' Jane Eyre.' ' Jane Eyre ' to run through a summary of 
the plot is the story of an orphan girl, reared at a Charity 
School amid many hardships, going out into the world as a 
governess, and falling in love with her employer, Mr. Roch- 
ester. She yields herself to her own passion and to his 
masterful love-making with an eager, an over-eager abandon- 
ment. The wedding-day is fixed ; the small marriage party 
assembles. But in the very church, and at the moment of 
the ceremony, it is revealed to Jane Eyre that Mr. Rochester 
has a wife living, a frenzied lunatic who has been confined 
for months in a corner of the same house where she and 
Rochester have had their daily dwelling; that Rochester 
has deliberately entrapped her, and that she stands on the 
edge of an abyss. The marriage party breaks up in confu- 
sion; and Rochester's next endeavour is to persuade the 



xii JANE EYRE 

stunned and miserable Jane to scout law and convention, and 
fly with him to love and foreign parts. He shows her the 
lunatic, in all the odious horror of her state, and Jane for- 
gives him on the spot, having never indeed, so far as ap- 
pears, felt any deep resentment of his conduct. Neverthe- 
less, she summons up courage to leave him. She steals away 
by night, and, after days of wandering and starvation, she 
finds a home with the Rivers family, who ultimately turn out 
to be her cousins. St. John Rivers, the brother of the fam- 
ily, an Evangelical clergyman possessed with a fanatical en- 
thusiasm for missionary life, observes the girl's strong and 
energetic nature, and makes up his mind to marry her, not 
in the least because he loves her, but because he thinks her 
fitted to be a missionary's wife. Her will is on the point of 
yielding to his, when she hears a mysterious midnight call 
from Rochester ; she hurries back to her master, to find him 
blinded and maimed by the fire which has destroyed his house 
and his mad wife together; and of course the end is happiness. 
Now certainly there never was a plot, which pretended to 
be a plot, of looser texture than that of ' Jane Eyre.' It 
abounds with absurdities and inconsistencies. The critics of 
Charlotte Bronte's time had no difficulty in pointing them 
out ; they He, indeed, on the surface for all to see. That 
such incidents should have happened to Jane Eyre in Mr. 
Rochester's house as did happen, without awakening her sus- 
picions ; that the existence of a lunatic should have been 
commonly known to all the servants of the house, yet wholly 
concealed from the governess; that Mr. Rochester should 
have been a man of honour and generosity, a man with whom 
not only Jane Eyre, but clearly the writer herself, is in love, 
and yet capable of deliberately betraying and deceiving a girl 
of twenty placed in a singularly helpless position ; these are 
the fundamental puzzles of the story. Mrs. Fairfax is a 
mystery throughout. How, knowing what she did, did she 
not inevitably know more? what was her real relation to 
Rochester ? to Jane Eyre ? These are questions that no 
one can answer out of the four corners of the book. The 
country-house party is a tissue of extravagance throughout; 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

the sarcasms and brutalities of the beautiful Miss Ingram 
are no more credible than the manners assumed by the aris- 
tocratic Rochester from the beginning towards his ward's 
governess, or the amazing freedom with which he pours into 
the ears of the same governess a virtuous girl of twenty, 
who has been no more than a few weeks under his roof the 
story of his relations with Adele's mother. 

Turn to the early scenes, for instance, between Jane and 
Rochester. They have been ' several days ' under the same 
roof ; it is Jane's second interview with her employer. Mr. 
Rochester, in Sultan fashion, sends for her and her pupil 
after dinner. He sits silent, while Jane's quick eye takes 
note of him. Suddenly he turns upon her. 

' You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he ; 'do you think me 
handsome?' 

Jane, taken by surprise, delivers a stout negative, whereupon 
her employer, in caprice or pique, pursues the subject further: 

' Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?' 

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally 
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual 
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benev- 
olence should have risen. 
' Now, ma'am, am I a fool ?' 

Poor Jane gets out of the dilemma as best she can, and 
gradually this astonishing gentleman thaws, becomes conver- 
sational and kind. And this is how he puts the little gov- 
erness at her ease : 

' You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre ; and though you 
are not pretty, any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air 
becomes you ; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those search- 
ing eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them 
with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on. Young lady, 
I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.' 

' Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communica- 
te to - night /' Not even ' Mr. Rawchester ' could exceed 
this. Parody has nothing to add. 



xiv JANE EYRE 

The country - house party is equally far from anything 
known, either to realistic or romantic truth, even to the truth 
as it existed in the days of 'Jane Eyre's' Quarterly Re- 
viewer and the Cowan Bridge School. Listen to the badinage 
of the beautiful and accomplished Miss Ingram. She is mak- 
ing brutal fun of governesses, in order to be overheard by 
the shy and shrinking Jane behind the window-curtain. Miss 
Ingram, it should be remarked, has never seen Jane before, 
has no grievance against her, and can only be supposed to 
be displaying the aristocratic temper as such. It pleases her 
to describe a love affair that her childhood had discovered 
between her own governess and her brother's tutor. She 
tells how she and her precious brothers and sisters employed 
it the love affair 'as a sort of lever to hoist our dead- 
weights from the house.' 

'. . . Dear mamma, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the 
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did 
you not, my lady-mother?' 

' Certainly, my best. And I was quite right, depend on that ; 
there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses 
and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well- 
regulated house ; firstly ' 

' Oh, gracious, mamrna ! spare us the enumeration ! An reste, 
we all know them : danger of bad example to the innocence of 
childhood distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the 
part of the attached mutual alliance and reliance; confidence 
thence resulting insolence accompanying mutiny and general 
blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ?' 

Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ! 

But Miss Ingram can also show herself as the gay and 
sprightly trifler with Rochester's well-bred homage. 

' Whenever I marry,' she continued, after a pause which none 
interrupted, ' I am resolved that my husband shall not be a rival, 
but a foil. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.' 

' I am all obedience,' was the response. 

' Here, then, is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs ; 
and for that reason sing it " con spirito." ' 

Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a 
mug of milk and water.' 



INTRODUCTION xv 

And so on. The whole scene from beginning to end is a 
piece of heavy grotesque, without either the truth or the fun 
of good satire. It was these pages, of course, and certain 
others like them in the book, that set George Henry Lewes 
preaching the 'mild eyes,' the 'truth,' and 'finish' of Miss 
Austen to the new and stormy genius which had produced 
' Jane Eyre.' And one may see, perhaps, in Charlotte's sore- 
ness, in the very vehemence that she shows under this particu- 
lar criticism, that, secretly, the shaft has gone home. She is, 
after all, infinitely shrewd, sensitive, and, in the end, just. She 
wrote a petulant letter to Mr. Lewes ; but she sent for ' Pride 
and Prejudice,' which she had never read, and the proba- 
bility is that, in spite of a natural antipathy, her quick eye 
took note at once of the fineness of stroke that goes to cari- 
cature itself in that immortal book ; that she pondered Mr. 
Collins and Lady Catharine de Burgh ; and that in the com- 
parative ease and urbanity which marked the painting of 
manners in ' Shirley,' the influence of her tilt with Lewes 
counts for something, 

As to the other weaknesses of plot and conception, they 
are very obvious and very simple. The 'arrangements' by 
which Jane Eyre is led to find a home in the Rivers house- 
hold, and becomes at once her uncle's heiress, and the good 
angel of her newly discovered cousins; the device of the 
phantom voice that recalls her to Rochester's side ; the fire 
that destroys the mad wife, and delivers into Jane's hands a 
subdued and helpless Rochester ; all these belong to that 
more mechanical and external sort of plot-making, which the 
modern novelist of feeling and passion as distinguished 
from the novelist of adventure prides himself on renouncing. 
To him the painting of a situation like that, say, in Benjamin 
Constant's ' Adolphe ' infinitely true, and wholly insoluble 
where the writer scorns to apply any coercive framework, 
any rough-and-ready 'plot' to his material, is the admirable 
and important thing. The true subject of ' Jane Eyre ' is the 
courage with which a friendless and loving girl confronts her 
own passion, and, in the interest of some strange social in- 
stinct which she knows as ' duty,' which she cannot explain 



xvi JANE EYRE 

and can only obey, tramples her love underfoot, and goes 
out miserable into the world. Beside this wrestle of the 
human will, everything else is trivial or vulgar. The various 
expedients legacies, uncles, fires, and coincidences by 
which Jane Eyre is ultimately brought to happiness, cheapen 
and degrade the book without convincing the reader. In 
fact to return to our advocatus diaboli ' " Jane Eyre " is on 
the one side a rather poor novel of incident, planned on the 
conventional pattern, and full of clumsy execution ; on an- 
other side it is a picture of passion and of ideas, for which in 
truth the writer had no sufficient equipment ; she moves im- 
prisoned, to quote Mr. Leslie Stephen, in " a narrow circle 
of thoughts ;" if you press it, the psychology of the book is 
really childish ; Rochester is absurd, Jane Eyre, in spite of 
the stir that she makes, only half-realised and half-conscious. 
Still, as a study of feeling, adapted to some extent to modern 
realist demands, the novel came at a happy moment. It is 
one of the signs, no doubt, that mark the transition from the 
old novel to the new, from the old novel of plot and coinci- 
dence to the new novel of psychology and character. But, 
given the defects of the book, how is it possible to assign it 
a high place in the history of that great modern art which 
has commanded the knowledge of a Tolstoy, and the mind 
of a Turgue'nieff, which is the subtle interpreter and not the 
vulgar stage-manager of nature, which shrinks from the mere-

INTRODUCTION 

TO 

JANE EYRE 



'JANE EYRE' was first published in October 1847. Half 
a century since this tale of the North by an unknown writer 
stole upon London, and, in the very midst of the serial publi- 
cation of ' Vanity Fair,' took the town by storm, obtaining for 
its author in the course of a few weeks a success which, as 
the creator of Becky Sharp afterwards said to her, a little 
sadly and sharply, 'it took me the work of ten years to 
achieve.' 

Half a century, in the view of the Roman Church, is often 
hardly sufficient to decide even the first step in the process 
of canonisation ; it is generally amply sufficient to decide all 
matters of literary rank and permanence. How has the ver- 
dict gone in the case of Currer Bell ? Have these fifty years 
'cut all meaning from the name,' or have they but filled it 
with a fuller content, wreathed it with memories and associa- 
tions that will for ever keep it luminous and delightful amid 
the dim tracts of the past ? 

Judging by the books that have been written and read in 
recent years, by the common verdict as to the Bronte sisters, 
their story, and their work, which prevails, almost without ex- 
ception, in the literary criticism of the present day; by the 
tone of personal tenderness, even of passionate homage, in 
which many writers speak of Charlotte and of Emily ; and by 
the increasing recognition which their books have obtained 



x JANE EYRE 

abroad, one may say with some confidence that the name and 
memory of the Brontes were never more alive than now, that 
' Honour and Fame have got about their graves ' for good 
and all, and that Charlotte and Emily Bronte are no less 
secure, at any rate, than Jane Austen or George Eliot or 
Mrs. Browning of literary recollection in the time to come. 

But if the Brontes live, their books live also. There are 
some names of the past Byron Voltaire that are far 
greater now, more full of magic and of spell, than the 
books associated with them that are, in fact, separable 
from the books, and could almost live on without them. But 
Charlotte Bronte is Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe. You can- 
not think of her apart from what she has written, and every- 
thing that she wrote has the challenging quality of personal 
emotion or of passion, moving in a narrow range among very 
concrete things, and intimately fused throughout with the in- 
cidents and feelings of one small, intense experience : so that, 
if one finds, as one does find abundantly, that the Brontes are 
remembered, it must be that their books are read, that people 
still sit up into the night with 'Jane Eyre,' and are still as 
angry as they were at the first, that they can get no one to 
assure them of Paul Emmanuel's safe return. 

So it must be; and so, indeed, the personal experience of 
most of us can vouch that it is. Nevertheless, here and 
there one may hear a protesting voice. Here and there a 
reader and generally a reader of more subtlety and range 
than his fellows struck with the union of certain extrava- 
gances and certain dogmatisms in Charlotte Bronte's work, 
with the weakness of Anne's and the crudity of Emily's, will 
dare to say, ' Not at all ! The vitality of the Bronte fame 
does not mean primarily the vitality of the Bronte books. It 
is a vitality which springs from the English love of the pa- 
thetic and the picturesque, and the English tendency to sub- 
ordinate matters of art to matters of sentiment. Mrs. Gas- 
kell, herself an accomplished novelist, wrote an account of 
these lonely girls on a Yorkshire moor, struggling with pov- 
erty and consumption, developing genius in the very wrestle 
with death, taking the heaven of fame by violence, and per-

ishing in the effort. She showed them to us oppressed by 
poverty and by daily contact with a vicious brother, and yet, 
through it all, remaining dutiful, loving, and virtuous, as the 
good English public likes them to be: she describes the 
deaths the piteous deaths of two of the sisters in the very 
moment, or on the very threshold, of success, and, finally, her 
narrative brought us to the death of Charlotte herself 
Charlotte snatched from happiness and from motherhood, 
after one brief year of married life : and so skilful is the tell- 
ing, so touching the story, that the great English heart goes 
out to it, and forthwith the Bronte books must be books of 
genius, because the Brontes are so interesting and their story 
so tragic.' 

Perhaps this explanation is put forward to account rather 
for the continuance of the Brontes' fame than for their origi- 
nal success. Such a critic would admit that 'Jane Eyre' 
is at least a vivid and exciting story; that 'Villette' has at 
least passages of extraordinary brilliance: but he will obsti- 
nately maintain, none the less, that other books, now forgot- 
ten, have had as much, and that the Bronte ' legend ' has 
unfairly strengthened the claim of the Bronte stories upon 
posterity. 

Let us see how such a contention stands in the case of 
' Jane Eyre.' ' Jane Eyre ' to run through a summary of 
the plot is the story of an orphan girl, reared at a Charity 
School amid many hardships, going out into the world as a 
governess, and falling in love with her employer, Mr. Roch- 
ester. She yields herself to her own passion and to his 
masterful love-making with an eager, an over-eager abandon- 
ment. The wedding-day is fixed ; the small marriage party 
assembles. But in the very church, and at the moment of 
the ceremony, it is revealed to Jane Eyre that Mr. Rochester 
has a wife living, a frenzied lunatic who has been confined 
for months in a corner of the same house where she and 
Rochester have had their daily dwelling; that Rochester 
has deliberately entrapped her, and that she stands on the 
edge of an abyss. The marriage party breaks up in confu- 
sion; and Rochester's next endeavour is to persuade the 



xii JANE EYRE 

stunned and miserable Jane to scout law and convention, and 
fly with him to love and foreign parts. He shows her the 
lunatic, in all the odious horror of her state, and Jane for- 
gives him on the spot, having never indeed, so far as ap- 
pears, felt any deep resentment of his conduct. Neverthe- 
less, she summons up courage to leave him. She steals away 
by night, and, after days of wandering and starvation, she 
finds a home with the Rivers family, who ultimately turn out 
to be her cousins. St. John Rivers, the brother of the fam- 
ily, an Evangelical clergyman possessed with a fanatical en- 
thusiasm for missionary life, observes the girl's strong and 
energetic nature, and makes up his mind to marry her, not 
in the least because he loves her, but because he thinks her 
fitted to be a missionary's wife. Her will is on the point of 
yielding to his, when she hears a mysterious midnight call 
from Rochester ; she hurries back to her master, to find him 
blinded and maimed by the fire which has destroyed his house 
and his mad wife together; and of course the end is happiness. 
Now certainly there never was a plot, which pretended to 
be a plot, of looser texture than that of ' Jane Eyre.' It 
abounds with absurdities and inconsistencies. The critics of 
Charlotte Bronte's time had no difficulty in pointing them 
out ; they He, indeed, on the surface for all to see. That 
such incidents should have happened to Jane Eyre in Mr. 
Rochester's house as did happen, without awakening her sus- 
picions ; that the existence of a lunatic should have been 
commonly known to all the servants of the house, yet wholly 
concealed from the governess; that Mr. Rochester should 
have been a man of honour and generosity, a man with whom 
not only Jane Eyre, but clearly the writer herself, is in love, 
and yet capable of deliberately betraying and deceiving a girl 
of twenty placed in a singularly helpless position ; these are 
the fundamental puzzles of the story. Mrs. Fairfax is a 
mystery throughout. How, knowing what she did, did she 
not inevitably know more? what was her real relation to 
Rochester ? to Jane Eyre ? These are questions that no 
one can answer out of the four corners of the book. The 
country-house party is a tissue of extravagance throughout; 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

the sarcasms and brutalities of the beautiful Miss Ingram 
are no more credible than the manners assumed by the aris- 
tocratic Rochester from the beginning towards his ward's 
governess, or the amazing freedom with which he pours into 
the ears of the same governess a virtuous girl of twenty, 
who has been no more than a few weeks under his roof the 
story of his relations with Adele's mother. 

Turn to the early scenes, for instance, between Jane and 
Rochester. They have been ' several days ' under the same 
roof ; it is Jane's second interview with her employer. Mr. 
Rochester, in Sultan fashion, sends for her and her pupil 
after dinner. He sits silent, while Jane's quick eye takes 
note of him. Suddenly he turns upon her. 

' You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he ; 'do you think me 
handsome?' 

Jane, taken by surprise, delivers a stout negative, whereupon 
her employer, in caprice or pique, pursues the subject further: 

' Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?' 

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally 
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual 
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benev- 
olence should have risen. 
' Now, ma'am, am I a fool ?' 

Poor Jane gets out of the dilemma as best she can, and 
gradually this astonishing gentleman thaws, becomes conver- 
sational and kind. And this is how he puts the little gov- 
erness at her ease : 

' You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre ; and though you 
are not pretty, any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air 
becomes you ; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those search- 
ing eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them 
with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on. Young lady, 
I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.' 

' Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communica- 
te to - night /' Not even ' Mr. Rawchester ' could exceed 
this. Parody has nothing to add. 



xiv JANE EYRE 

The country - house party is equally far from anything 
known, either to realistic or romantic truth, even to the truth 
as it existed in the days of 'Jane Eyre's' Quarterly Re- 
viewer and the Cowan Bridge School. Listen to the badinage 
of the beautiful and accomplished Miss Ingram. She is mak- 
ing brutal fun of governesses, in order to be overheard by 
the shy and shrinking Jane behind the window-curtain. Miss 
Ingram, it should be remarked, has never seen Jane before, 
has no grievance against her, and can only be supposed to 
be displaying the aristocratic temper as such. It pleases her 
to describe a love affair that her childhood had discovered 
between her own governess and her brother's tutor. She 
tells how she and her precious brothers and sisters employed 
it the love affair 'as a sort of lever to hoist our dead- 
weights from the house.' 

'. . . Dear mamma, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the 
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did 
you not, my lady-mother?' 

' Certainly, my best. And I was quite right, depend on that ; 
there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses 
and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well- 
regulated house ; firstly ' 

' Oh, gracious, mamrna ! spare us the enumeration ! An reste, 
we all know them : danger of bad example to the innocence of 
childhood distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the 
part of the attached mutual alliance and reliance; confidence 
thence resulting insolence accompanying mutiny and general 
blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ?' 

Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park ! 

But Miss Ingram can also show herself as the gay and 
sprightly trifler with Rochester's well-bred homage. 

' Whenever I marry,' she continued, after a pause which none 
interrupted, ' I am resolved that my husband shall not be a rival, 
but a foil. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.' 

' I am all obedience,' was the response. 

' Here, then, is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs ; 
and for that reason sing it " con spirito." ' 

Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a 
mug of milk and water.' 



INTRODUCTION xv 

And so on. The whole scene from beginning to end is a 
piece of heavy grotesque, without either the truth or the fun 
of good satire. It was these pages, of course, and certain 
others like them in the book, that set George Henry Lewes 
preaching the 'mild eyes,' the 'truth,' and 'finish' of Miss 
Austen to the new and stormy genius which had produced 
' Jane Eyre.' And one may see, perhaps, in Charlotte's sore- 
ness, in the very vehemence that she shows under this particu- 
lar criticism, that, secretly, the shaft has gone home. She is, 
after all, infinitely shrewd, sensitive, and, in the end, just. She 
wrote a petulant letter to Mr. Lewes ; but she sent for ' Pride 
and Prejudice,' which she had never read, and the proba- 
bility is that, in spite of a natural antipathy, her quick eye 
took note at once of the fineness of stroke that goes to cari- 
cature itself in that immortal book ; that she pondered Mr. 
Collins and Lady Catharine de Burgh ; and that in the com- 
parative ease and urbanity which marked the painting of 
manners in ' Shirley,' the influence of her tilt with Lewes 
counts for something, 

As to the other weaknesses of plot and conception, they 
are very obvious and very simple. The 'arrangements' by 
which Jane Eyre is led to find a home in the Rivers house- 
hold, and becomes at once her uncle's heiress, and the good 
angel of her newly discovered cousins; the device of the 
phantom voice that recalls her to Rochester's side ; the fire 
that destroys the mad wife, and delivers into Jane's hands a 
subdued and helpless Rochester ; all these belong to that 
more mechanical and external sort of plot-making, which the 
modern novelist of feeling and passion as distinguished 
from the novelist of adventure prides himself on renouncing. 
To him the painting of a situation like that, say, in Benjamin 
Constant's ' Adolphe ' infinitely true, and wholly insoluble 
where the writer scorns to apply any coercive framework, 
any rough-and-ready 'plot' to his material, is the admirable 
and important thing. The true subject of ' Jane Eyre ' is the 
courage with which a friendless and loving girl confronts her 
own passion, and, in the interest of some strange social in- 
stinct which she knows as ' duty,' which she cannot explain 



xvi JANE EYRE 

and can only obey, tramples her love underfoot, and goes 
out miserable into the world. Beside this wrestle of the 
human will, everything else is trivial or vulgar. The various 
expedients legacies, uncles, fires, and coincidences by 
which Jane Eyre is ultimately brought to happiness, cheapen 
and degrade the book without convincing the reader. In 
fact to return to our advocatus diaboli ' " Jane Eyre " is on 
the one side a rather poor novel of incident, planned on the 
conventional pattern, and full of clumsy execution ; on an- 
other side it is a picture of passion and of ideas, for which in 
truth the writer had no sufficient equipment ; she moves im- 
prisoned, to quote Mr. Leslie Stephen, in " a narrow circle 
of thoughts ;" if you press it, the psychology of the book is 
really childish ; Rochester is absurd, Jane Eyre, in spite of 
the stir that she makes, only half-realised and half-conscious. 
Still, as a study of feeling, adapted to some extent to modern 
realist demands, the novel came at a happy moment. It is 
one of the signs, no doubt, that mark the transition from the 
old novel to the new, from the old novel of plot and coinci- 
dence to the new novel of psychology and character. But, 
given the defects of the book, how is it possible to assign it 
a high place in the history of that great modern art which 
has commanded the knowledge of a Tolstoy, and the mind 
of a Turgue'nieff, which is the subtle interpreter and not the 
vulgar stage-manager of nature, which shrinks from the mere-
